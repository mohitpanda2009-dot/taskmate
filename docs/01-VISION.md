# 01 — Vision & Problem Statement

## 🎯 One-Liner
**TaskMate** — India ka micro-task marketplace. Chhote kaam, achi kamai.

## Problem Statement

### For Task Creators (People who need help)
- Need someone for small tasks: stand in a queue at RTO, pick up a document, fill a form, deliver something nearby
- Currently rely on: asking friends/family (social debt), WhatsApp groups (unreliable), random labor (no trust, no accountability)
- No organized platform for ₹100-₹2000 micro-tasks
- Can't verify strangers, no payment protection, no recourse if task fails

### For Task Doers (People who want to earn)
- Students, part-timers, delivery riders, unemployed youth — want flexible income
- Current options: Swiggy/Zomato (low pay, long hours), daily wage work (inconsistent), freelancing (skill barrier)
- No platform for earning from simple physical tasks
- No trust system to build a reputation

### The Gap
India has **hundreds of millions** of people who need small tasks done AND people who'd happily do them for fair pay. But there's **no trusted marketplace** connecting them for micro-tasks.

Urban Company solved this for home services. Dunzo solved it for deliveries. **TaskMate solves it for everything else.**

## Vision
Become India's default platform for getting any small task done — from standing in line to filling forms to running errands. Think of it as **"Uber for micro-tasks"** — open the app, post what you need, someone nearby picks it up and gets it done.
